* count only fragments that were properly aligned
* annotate with GENCODE gene model
* primary alignments were counted, even if the fragments aligned multiple times
* fragments aligning to multiple features were assigned to the feature that mostly closely overlapped with the fragment
* exogenous RNA counts are total fragments that aligned
